Purpose:
    This test module verifies the correctness of the Course Management functionality
    implemented in the application layer. It ensures that courses can be added,
    modified, deleted, and that course conflicts can be managed within the scheduler
    configuration according to the project user stories (Chunk A — A2 Course Management).

Scope:
    - Add Course:
        Confirms that new courses are correctly inserted into the configuration
        with credits and room assignments and can be listed afterward.

    - Modify Course:
        Confirms that existing course attributes (such as credits) can be updated
        and reflected in the configuration.

    - Manage Course Conflicts:
        Confirms that conflicts can be added, modified, and deleted between courses
        and that conflict relationships are stored correctly.

    - Delete Course:
        Confirms that courses can be removed and no longer appear in the configuration.

Testing Strategy:
    - Uses temporary or test configuration files to avoid modifying real data.
    - Validates both successful operations and expected failure cases.
    - Ensures service-layer functions properly update and persist configuration data.
