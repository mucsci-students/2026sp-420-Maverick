# Maverick Scheduler

A Flask-based web application for managing configuration data and generating academic course schedules.

The project began as a Sprint 1 CLI scheduler and was extended in Sprint 2 with a web GUI built using **Flask**. The GUI supports loading and editing scheduler configurations, generating schedules with per-run overrides, browsing generated schedules, and importing/exporting schedule files.

> Note: This README focuses on how to run the **Flask web app** and the **test suite**. CLI usage can be found within **"CLI_USAGE.md"**.

## Getting Started

The steps below allow a new user to install dependencies, run tests, and start the web application.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository
```Bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 2026sp-420-Maverick
```

---

### 2. Install uv

This project uses uv to manage Python environments and dependencies.

### macOS / Linux
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
### Or install with pip
pip install uv

---

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

From the project root directory run:
```Bash
uv sync
```

This will:
-   create a virtual environment
-   install dependencies defined in pyproject.toml
-   install Flask, pytest, and the scheduler engine

---

## Running the Web Application

The Sprint 2 GUI is built using Flask.

Start the development server:

```
uv run flask --app app.web:create_app --debug run
```
Open the address shown in your terminal:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
The application will redirect to the Config Editor.

Stop the server with:
```
Ctrl + C
```

---

## First-Time Usage Workflow

A typical workflow for a new user is:

### 1. Open the Config Editor

When the application launches, it redirects to:
```
/config
```
The Config Editor allows you to manage the scheduler configuration.

---

### 2. Load a Configuration

Load one of the included configs such as:
```
configs/config_dev.json
configs/config_test.json
```
Or upload a JSON configuration file from your computer.

---

### 3. Edit Configuration

The Config Editor supports managing:

=   Faculty
=   Courses
=   Conflicts
=   Rooms
-   Labs

Changes are applied to the working configuration.

---

### 4. Generate Schedules

Navigate to:
```
/run
```
Here you can:
-   override the generation limit
-   enable or disable optimizer flags
-   generate schedules using the solver

---

### 5. Browse Generated Schedules

Navigate to:

```
/viewer
```

The Schedule Viewer allows users to:

-   navigate between schedules
-   directly select schedules
-   inspect schedule metadata
-   view schedules grouped by:
-       faculty
-       room
-       lab
-   filter tables by:
-       specific faculty
-       specific room
-       specific lab
-   import previously saved schedules
-   export schedules to JSON or CSV
-   open grid or visual schedule views

---

## Local AI and Flask Configuration

To run the AI Chat Tool locally with your own settings, create a local settings file:

```bash
cp app/local_settings.example.py app/local_settings.py
```

Then open `app/local_settings.py` and fill in your own values:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"
FLASK_SECRET_KEY = "your-flask-secret-key"
MAVERICK_OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-5-mini"
```

### Notes
- `app/local_settings.py` is ignored by Git and should not be committed
- Environment variables are still supported as a fallback
- `gpt-5-mini` is the default model if no model is provided

---

## 🤖 AI Chat Tool (Natural Language Configuration)

The Maverick Scheduler includes an AI-powered assistant that allows users to modify configurations using natural language.

### Example Commands
- Add course CS102 with 3 credits in Roddy 140  
- Change the credits of CS199 to 4  
- Rename course CS163 to CS370  
- Add faculty Dr. Jones with appointment type full-time  

👉 Full command reference: [AI Command Guide](docs/ai-commands.md)

---

## Running Tests

The project uses **pytest**.

Run all tests:
```
uv run pytest
```
 
Run tests with verbose output:
```
uv run pytest -v
```

Run a specific test file:
```
uv run pytest tests/test_faculty.py
```

Other test files include:
```
tests/test_course.py
tests/test_room.py
tests/test_lab.py
tests/test_config_service.py
```

### Testing Commands

Run all tests:
uv run pytest

or 

uv run pytest tests/[filename] -q

---

## Running Tests with Coverage

To run all tests with coverage locally:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=app --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml
```

---

## Configuration Files

Example configurations are included in:

```
configs/config_dev.json
configs/config_test.json
configs/config_base.json
```

These can be loaded directly through the GUI.

---

## MVC Architecture

The project follows a **Model–View–Controller** architecture.

### Model / Domain Logic

Located in:
```
app/config_ops/
app/faculty_management/
app/course_management/
app/room_management/
app/lab_management/
scheduler_core/
```
Handles:
-   configuration logic
-   CRUD operations
-   scheduling constraints
-   scheduler execution

---

### View Layer

Located in:
```
app/web/templates/
app/web/static/
```
Contains:

-   Jinja templates
-   CSS styling
-   JavaScript UI behavior

---

### Controller Layer

Located in:
```
app/web/routes/
```
Responsible for:

-   Flask routes
-   request handling
-   redirect logic
-   calling services
-   updating session state

---

### Service Layer

Located in:

```
app/web/services/
```
Services connect Flask routes to the scheduling logic.

---

## Design Pattern: Command

Our application implements the **Command design pattern** within the AI configuration feature located in `app/web/services/ai_service.py` and `app/web/services/ai_tools.py`.

### Problem

The AI chat tool allows users to modify the scheduler configuration using natural language (e.g., “Add course CS102” or “Remove Room A”). This creates the challenge of safely handling many different types of requests without hardcoding logic for each case or allowing unrestricted direct access to the configuration.

### Pattern

The **Command pattern** encapsulates a request as an object, allowing it to be parameterized and executed independently. This aligns with the definition from the course slides: encapsulating a command request as an object.

### Implementation

In our system, each user request is interpreted by the AI and mapped to a specific backend tool function:

- `add_course`
- `remove_room`
- `rename_course`
- `modify_course_credits`

Each of these operations represents a **command**, consisting of:

- a command name (tool name)
- arguments (parameters for the action)
- execution logic (handled by backend functions)

The `execute_tool(tool_name, args)` function acts as a dispatcher, routing each request to the correct command implementation.

### How It Solves the Problem

By encapsulating user actions as commands:

- The system can safely control which operations are allowed
- New commands can be added without modifying existing logic
- The AI does not directly manipulate the configuration, improving security and maintainability

This approach makes the system more modular, and extensible.

---

## Design Pattern: Observer

1. Observer (Behavioral Pattern)
Located in 
```
app/web/templates/visual_schedule.html
```
Details:
- A central State object is used to control the filtering used with the visual calendar view (visual_schedule.html).
- When the state changes (e.g.: day changes to 'Monday') all parts of the UI that use the state update themselves automatically.

- Shown: CalendarState object manages the filters. Instead of one giant function (what it started as), there are smaller "listeners" that handle on job (e.g.: one listener for Day filter, one for Room filter).

- CalendarState holds the state of the calendar filtering. When a value changes, it notifies all "subscribed" functions to update themselves. 
- A new function is called when the state changes. 
- If a top category is changed then the sub-filters are reset.

- Observer 1 is used to update the main view sections.
(All, Faculty, Rooms, Labs)
- State also controls the visibility of the sub-filtering.
(e.g.: Show-Faculty, Filter - Hobbs)

- Observer 2 is used to update the calendar container visibility (sub-filtering).

- Observer 3 is used to update the day grid layout.

- Event handlers are used to update the UI button styles, and update the state.

---

## Command (Behavoiral Pattern)
Located in 
```
app/web/routes/run_routes.py
app/web/static/app.js
app/web/templates/generator.html
```
Details:

- The user presses the generate button which makes a request not knowing anything about generating schedules (generator.html)

- The generate route makes a request to the generate_schedules_into_session function without knowing anything about it (run_route.py)

- The js keeps queuing commands which are periodically checked (app.js)

---

## Troubleshooting
### Flask will not start

Make sure you run:

```Bash
uv run flask --app app.web:create_app --debug run
```
from the project root directory.

---

### Dependencies appear missing
Run:
```Bash
uv sync
```
again from the root directory.

---

### Port already in use

If the Flask server reports that the port is already in use, stop the existing process or restart the terminal session.

---

### Viewer shows no schedules

Make sure you:

1. loaded a configuration

2. generated schedules from /run

3. navigated to /viewer

---

## Running Linting, Formatting, and Type Checks

After installing dependencies with:

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

Run the linter:
```
uv run ruff check .
```

Run the formatter:
```
uv run ruff format .
```

Check formatting without changing files:
```
uv run ruff format . --check
```

Run ty:
```
uv run ty check app tests
```

### What to run locally after you make changes

From the repo root:

```bash
uv sync --dev
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv run ty check app tests
uv run pytest --cov=app --cov-branch --cov-report=xml
```
